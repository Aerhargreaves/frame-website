                I am Alice, a maker, designer and repairist.
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe creatives are storytellers and their objects hold narratives. For me that object is spectacles. They have so many stories to tell, some we know well, others we very rarely hear of and some entirely personal. To their wearers a frame is so many things - a medical aid, an accessory, an expression of identity, an extension of their face and features. So many roles!
                <br>
                <br>
                Raised by two D&T teachers, tinkering was big part of growing up. I first found my obsession in the fine woodworking of Japan & China. After studying at Central Saint Martins UAL, I found a practice in research-led design and methodology. After entering the world of work I found my place as an eyewear designer, but it wasn't quite right. For me, frames aren't a product but a medium, much like a potter and their clay. 
                <br>
                <br>
                So I have settled here, a frame artist. Working in the medium of spectacle making. Through small collections of handmade frames I try to explore different ideas, identities, locations and behaviours. Ask questions about how we value our resources and who our world is designed for. I also design bespoke pieces & refurbish antique frames, listening to your stories and crafting objects that celebrate your unique features.
                <br>
                <br>
                This journey has really only just begun and I'm not quite sure where it will take me but I guarantee it will hold a window in front of an eye, it will be handmade and one of a kind.
